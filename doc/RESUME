INTERESTS, PHILOSOPHY
=====================

    I have been employed as a computer programmer a total of 7 years,
3 of which where under independent contract. I have experience in
almost every field of computer programming, and can feel comfortable
in any development environment. I take my code very seriously, and
promote its clarity and maintainability above all else.

    Today I use Python for almost everything. I am familar with the
C-Python API, and have read and written many Python extensions using
it. I have complete knowledge and understanding of the Qt toolkit
(trolltech.com) and PyQt, its python bindings
(riverbankcomputing.co.uk). 

    Other personal interests include music production and cross -
country running and skiing. I consider healthy living to be an
important part of being successful both personally and
professionally. This makes me a better programmer, and more
importantly, a better person.
